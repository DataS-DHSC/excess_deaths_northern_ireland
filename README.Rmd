# Excess deaths

This project is to support the UK four nations to calculate their excess mortality in the same way that the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities has done so for England through the course of the pandemic.

# Data requirements

To calculate excess deaths like in this repository, the following data is needed:

* annual mid-year population estimates for the years of the baseline period (including an extra year before and after this period), and the years for the period for the expected (again, including an extra year before and after). These data should have the following fields:

  * areacode
  * sex
  * age_group
  * deprivation_quintile (optional)
  * population
  
* weekly registered deaths for the baseline period and the expected period. The week dates should be for the Friday, which represents the period Saturday to Friday. The following fields are required:
 
  * week_ending
  * areacode
  * sex
  * age_group
  * deprivation_quintile (optional)
  * registered_deaths

# Navigating the repository

The folder structure can be described as follows:

```
+-- data/ - store raw input data here
+-- outputs/ - the outputs can be stored here. Suggested folders are for dispersion_parameters, models, predictions, visualisations
+-- R/ - contains R scripts labelled in order of how they are used and what purpose the have
+-- renv/ - automatically generated using the renv package, no need to modify
```
